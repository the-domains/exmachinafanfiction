[Pharrell Douglas:][0]

It's been around two weeks since I started. Now I'm almost done writing the first draft of the novel for Ex-Machina. I'm currently on the scene where Ava is in the glass corridor and sees Nathan and begins to charge towards him when she realizes he will never let her out. It's been pretty exciting and I can't wait to refine this draft next week and soon make it available!
